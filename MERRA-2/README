First, create a Forcings directory where all the MERRA netcdf
files will go.

Second, you will need to set up an account at urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
and enter your account information in your $HOME/.netrc file.

In the old days, one would then simply run the 
get_MERRA_Forcings_from_nasa_opendap_3hours.bash
script and answer the question about which year to run:

  % get_MERRA_Forcings_from_nasa_opendap_3hours.bash
  Enter a year to process: 2014

and it would go off and do its thing for a while. Now I'm getting
timeout errors:

   urllib2.URLError: <urlopen error [Errno 110] Connection timed out>

I have restructured the code so that it creates a new file for each
month and I'm using ncrcat to string months together for yearly files.
I run these one at a time:

   python get_MERRA_swrad_from_nasa_opendap_3hours.py 2016

and when it fails in April, I edit the loop around line 110:

    - for month in range(12):
    + for month in range(3,12):

and restart it. It's confusing because January is month 0 and April is
month 3. I might change this...
